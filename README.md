## My process
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
- I put into practice the use of attribute selectors, as well as top-down selectors. These generated a clearer css code, rather than multiple classes or id's.
- I opted to create the card from scratch, without the help of frameworks, such as Bootstrap.
- I aligned images along with text using the float property.

### Continued development
- I could not perform the "active" state of the main image. It is an issue that I continue to test how to solve, and look for material about it.
- It took me a long time to finish this challenge, which is the first one I did in my entire life, but I hope to continue learning even more with the next ones.

## Author
My name is Alicia Napolitano. 
I am an "old" student of the subject of programming, but not for that reason with less desire to continue learning.
I don't know much more than I do, but I'm not going to give up, I'll keep looking for material to update myself. In fact, this proposal to specify challenges is very motivating, I appreciate the opportunity given by Frontend Mentor!
